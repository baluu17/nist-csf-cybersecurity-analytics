# NIST CSF–Aligned Cybersecurity Analytics Platform

This project implements an end-to-end cybersecurity analytics pipeline aligned with the
**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)** using
**Python** and the **CIC-IDS2017** intrusion detection dataset.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data analytics and machine learning can be
used to support **SOC-style security monitoring and incident handling**.

---

## NIST CSF Mapping

- **Identify**  
  Asset and service risk scoring based on attack exposure and traffic behaviour

- **Protect**  
  Baseline policy creation and rule-based violation analysis

- **Detect**  
  Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM

- **Respond**  
  Incident generation, severity assignment, and analyst-friendly summaries

- **Recover**  
  Post-incident analysis and recommendations for system improvement

## Data Source

This project uses the **CIC-IDS2017** intrusion detection dataset.

Due to file size limitations, raw and processed datasets are not included in this repository.
All datasets can be downloaded from the official source and regenerated by running the
notebooks in sequence, starting from `01_data_loading_overview.ipynb`.

Dataset source:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chethuhn/network-intrusion-dataset/data

### Files Used

- **Monday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv** – baseline traffic  
- **Tuesday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv** – mixed traffic  
- **Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos.pcap_ISCX.csv** – attack-heavy traffic

## Repository Structure

### Notebooks

- **01_data_loading_overview.ipynb**  
  Loads the CIC-IDS2017 datasets and provides an initial overview of features and labels.

- **02_data_cleaning.ipynb**  
  Cleans, standardises, and prepares the raw data for analysis and modelling.

- **03_identify_risk_scoring.ipynb**  
  Implements the **Identify** function of the NIST CSF by scoring and ranking network services
  based on risk exposure.

- **04_protect_access_analysis.ipynb**  
  Implements the **Protect** function by defining baseline behaviour and analysing policy
  violations.

- **05_detect_anomaly_detection.ipynb**  
  Implements the **Detect** function using Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM to identify
  anomalous network flows.

- **06_respond_incident_summary.ipynb**  
  Implements the **Respond** function by converting detected anomalies into prioritised
  incident summaries with severity levels.

- **07_recover_post_incident_analysis.ipynb**  
  Implements the **Recover** function by analysing incidents and generating lessons learned
  and improvement recommendations.

- **08_visual_insights.ipynb**  
  Contains visual summaries and line graphs used for project demonstration and LinkedIn
  sharing.
